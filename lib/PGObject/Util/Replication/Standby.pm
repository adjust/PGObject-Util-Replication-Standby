PGObject::Util::Replication::Standby - Manage PG replication standbys

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS


    use PGObject::Util::Replication::Standby;

    my $replica = PGObject::Util::Replication::Standby->new();
    $replica->standby_name('denver', 1); // uses slot denver
    $replica->upstream_host('pgmain.chicago.mydomain.foo');

    #however you may be better off setting cert auth instead.
    $replica->credentials('foo', 'superdupersecret');

    # finally get the recovery.conf contents
    $replica->recoveryconf_contents();

    ### manage replication slots
    # clearing all slots, for example failing over
    $replica->clearslots();

    # list all slots
    $replica->slots();

    # add new slot
    $replica->addslot('downstream1');

    # delete slot
    $replica->deleteslot('downstream2');
    

    #also ways to measure recovery lag
    $lsn = $standby->recovery_lsn(); # current recovery log location
    $standby->lag_bytes_from($lsn);

    # Forthcoming
    $standby->promote('trigger');

    # we can also get the master from the connection string, for example to look up the 
    # wal segments

    my $wal_info = $standby->master->ping_wall();

=head1 DESCRIPTION AND USE

This module manages replication-related functions on standbys.

A I<standby> is a physical replica (i.e. data files are brought to the same
structure).  Logical replication in this case is not supported in terms of
failover and the like.

This module was written to make the task of managing replicated systems from
Rex much easier.  The module thus supports the three basic aspects of 
replication management:

=over

=item Configuration management of upstream and downstream links

=item WAL telemetry on the receiving end, and calculating lag

=item Promotion of a standby in a failover case.

=back

=head1 STANDBY PROPERTIES

All of those of an SMO plus

for promoting a standby.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Recovery Configuration

Recovery configuration here provides a basic interface for working with the parameters
in the recovery.conf file.  Note that this file cannot be managed via ALTER SYSTEM
so a physical file must be generated even once this is supported in PGObject::Util::PGConfig

=head3 set_recovery_param($name, $value)

Sets the parameter for the recovery.conf

=cut

sub set_recovery_param {
    my ($self, $name, $value) = @_;
    $self->recoveryconf->set($name, $value);
}

=head3 connection_string

=head3 connection_string($cstring)

Generates the connection string from the current attributes for the SMO.

We accept reading aboth formats (key/value and URI).  We always write URIs.

This function in either form has the side effect of updating the 
primary_conninfo field in the recoveryconf property.

    }
    return $self->connection_string;
}


=head3 from_recoveryconf($path)

Sets all appropriate parameters from a given recovery.conf at a valid path.

This weill normalize the connection string in URL format.

=cut

sub from_recoveryconf {
    my ($self, $path) = @_;
    $self->recoveryconf->fromfile($path);
    $self->recoveryconf_path($path);
    $self->_set_connection_string($self->recoveryconf->get_value('primary_conninfo'));
}

=head3 recoveryconf_contents

Returns the contents of the recovery.conf to be used.

=cut

sub recoveryconf_contents {
    my ($self) = @_;
    $self->recoveryconf->set('standby_mode', 1);
    $self->set_recovery_param('primary_slot_name', $self->standby_name)
      if $self->standby_name;
    $self->connection_string;
    return $self->recoveryconf->filecontents . "\n";
}

=head3 credentials($user, $pass)

Sets the username and password.

=cut

sub credentials {
    my ($self, $user, $pass) = @_;
    $self->upstream_user($user);
    $self->upstream_password($pass);
    $self->connection_string;
    return;
}

=head2 WAL telemetry

WAL telemetry works differently on standby than on a master.  The standby is not in charge
of writes and so there is no "current" wal location.  Instead we go by the latest received
location.

This has a number of important implications.  After STONITH, we can quickly poll a set of replicas to see who is most current and redirect traffic there.  This is most useful in a server down
situation so you can ensure that the most recent replica is failed over to.

This can also be used to check WAL telemetry against that on the master to see if there are 
slow links regarding non-synchronous standby servers and the like.

=head3 lag_bytes_from($lsn)

Returns the number of bytes passed on the recovery connection between the 
log series number (lsn) and the current recovery position.

=cut

sub lag_bytes_from {
    my ($self, $lsn) = @_;
    my $dbh = $self->connect;
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT ?::pg_lsn - pg_last_xlog_receive_location()");
    $sth->execute($lsn);
    return ($sth->fetchrow_array)[0];
}

=head2 Upstream traversal

=head3 upstream()

Provides a generic SMO for the immediate upstream server.

=head3 master()

Traverses upstream until it finds a server which is not recovering and returns a Master SMO for
that server.

=head2 Promotion

Promotion can be done in this case if we can touch a trigger file specified in the recovery.conf
or if we can remove the recovery.conf and restart PostgreSQL.

=head3 promote($method)

Promotes a slave to master.  First tries the trigger file if available.
Otherwise tries to rename the recovery.conf and restart.  Methods tried are:

=over

=item trigger:  write to trigger file

=item recoveryconf: delete recovery.conf

=back

We can only restart if PGObject::Util::Replication::SMO supports
restarting the cluster.

=cut

sub _promote_trigger {
    my ($self) = @_;
    local $!;
    my $trigger = $self->recoveryconf->get_value('trigger_file');
    return unless $trigger;
    warn $trigger;
    open(my $fh, '>', $trigger) or die $!;
    print $fh "\n";
    close $fh;
    return 1;
}

sub _promote_recoveryconf {
    my ($self) = @_;
    croak 'No recoveryconf_path set up' unless $self->recoveryconf_path;
    return unlink $self->recoveryconf_path;
}


sub promote {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return $self->_promote_trigger 
         if $self->recoveryconf->get_value('trigger_file');
    my $retval = $self->_promote_recoveryconf();
    $self->restart if $self->can('restart'); # if supported by SMO
    return $retval;
}
